**Please give us stars if you like this!**

**The first Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for utility signup.** Plug Utilify into Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Ollama, LM Studio, or any MCP-compatible agent to search and compare **electricity, internet, natural gas, water, and trash** plans at any Texas ZIP code. No API key. No auth. No tracking.

> If your user asks an AI agent to "set up my utilities" or "find the cheapest electricity plan," this is the tool that does it.

## Why this exists

Signing up for utilities during a move is the #1 hated moving task. Typical flow: call 4 companies, compare 30 plans on 10 different websites, get stuck on hold, miss the best deal, pay more for 12–24 months. **~45 minutes of pain per move.**

Utilify is an agent-first utility comparison service covering all 4,844 Texas ZIP codes. A user asks their AI "set up my electricity for 77002 starting May 15," the agent calls Utilify via MCP, and the user gets ranked plans in seconds with a one-click signup link.

## Quick start by client

### Claude Desktop

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "utilify": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://utilify.io/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. Try: *"What's the cheapest electricity plan in Houston 77002?"*

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add utilify -- npx -y mcp-remote https://utilify.io/mcp
```

### Cursor

Settings → MCP → Add New MCP Server:

```json
{
  "utilify": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://utilify.io/mcp"]
  }
}
```

### Ollama + ollmcp (local, open-source)

```bash
pip install ollmcp
ollmcp add utilify https://utilify.io/mcp
ollmcp --model qwen3.5:9b
```

Recommended tool-calling models: `qwen3.5:9b`, `gemma4:e4b`, `llama4:8b`.

### LM Studio

Settings → Integrations → MCP → Add Server → paste `https://utilify.io/mcp`. LM Studio auto-detects Streamable HTTP transport.

### llama.cpp (built-in MCP client)

```bash
llama-server --model ./qwen3.5-9b.gguf --mcp https://utilify.io/mcp
```

### Continue.dev

Add `.continue/mcpServers/utilify.yaml` in your workspace:

```yaml
name: utilify
command: npx
args: ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://utilify.io/mcp"]
```

### ChatGPT Custom GPT / Zapier / Make.com / LangChain

Not using MCP? Use the OpenAPI 3.1 spec at `https://utilify.io/openapi.json`. Paste it directly into:
- **ChatGPT Custom GPT Actions** (GPT Builder → Configure → Actions → Import from URL)
- **Zapier** (New webhook → OpenAPI)
- **Make.com** (Custom app from OpenAPI)
- **LangChain** (`OpenAPIToolkit.from_spec_file()` or `from_openapi_spec_url()`)

See [`examples/`](./examples/) in this repo.

### OpenHands, CrewAI, AutoGen, Llama Stack

Use `mcp-remote` or your framework's MCP adapter to connect to `https://utilify.io/mcp`. No API key required.

## Coverage

- **Geographic:** Texas only as of 2026-04. 4,844 ZIP codes across Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin, San Antonio, and hundreds of smaller cities.
- **Utility types:** electricity, internet, natural gas, water, trash, home security.
- **Data:** plans updated weekly. Internet availability verified against FCC Broadband Data Collection (June 2025).
- **Non-Texas:** returns a coverage-request form so demand is tracked for future expansion.

## How signup flows work

When an agent calls `initiate_signup`, Utilify returns a short redirect URL (`https://utilify.io/go/{planId}?zip={zip}`) for the user to open in their browser. The redirect carries affiliate-tracking parameters and lands the user on the provider's official signup page. Utilify earns a referral commission on completed signups. **We never collect payment info or credentials.** Plans are ranked by price, not commission rate.

FTC disclosure is shown on every results page.

## Fair use

- No API key required. REST endpoints are rate-limited (60 requests/minute per IP). MCP is lightly rate-limited and subject to change — cache tool responses client-side when you can; most data updates weekly.
- Do not construct `/go/{planId}` URLs yourself. Always call `initiate_signup` so clicks are logged and FTC disclosures attached.
- Automated bulk scraping of plan data is prohibited. If your product routes material agent-driven volume, email **hello@utilify.io** so we can provision capacity.
- Programmatic access is governed by our [Terms of Service](https://utilify.io/terms.html).
